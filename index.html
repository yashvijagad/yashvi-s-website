    A website (also written as web site) is a collection of web pages
    and related content that is identified by a common domain name and
    published on at least one web server. Examples of notable websites
    are Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Wikipedia.
  </p>

  <p>
    All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web.
    There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a private network,
    such as a company's internal website for its employees.
  </p>

  <p>
    Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news,
    education, commerce, entertainment, or social networking. Hyperlinking between 
    web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page.
